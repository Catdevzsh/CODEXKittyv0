CODEXKittyv0: A Portal to OpenAI's Codex
This repository houses CODEXKittyv0, an attempt to emulate the functionality of OpenAI's Codex API through a user-friendly interface.
What is Codex?
OpenAI Codex was a powerful AI model designed specifically to generate code from natural language instructions. It was capable of understanding and generating code in multiple programming languages and across a wide range of domains. Codex could be used for tasks like:
Generating code snippets from comments
Debugging code
Answering natural language queries about code
Providing code completions
While the Codex API is no longer publicly accessible, this project aims to revive its spirit and capabilities.
About CODEXKittyv0
CODEXKittyv0 is currently under development and aims to provide:
Intuitive Interface: A simple and easy-to-use interface for interacting with the Codex emulation.
Multi-Language Support: The ability to generate code in various programming languages.
Extensible Functionality: Potential for future expansion to include features like debugging assistance and code analysis.
How to Use
Detailed instructions on how to set up and utilize CODEXKittyv0 will be provided soon. Stay tuned for updates!
